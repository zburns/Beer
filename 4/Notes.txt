Started a batch of Red Ale today.

Got a long pot thermometer for Christmas and decided to use that for monitoring my steeping of grains.
When I went to unwrap it, the glass on the thermometer was broken so I picked all the glass out to make sure it wouldnâ€™t fall into the pot.  I used this thermometer to steep the grains for 20 minutes and made sure the temperature didn't exceed 165 degrees.  

I turned up the heat and got a gentle boil going before putting in the rest of the LME and notice it didn't take long at all to get to the boil.  I checked the termometer again and noticed it was still showing the 165 degrees - Uh, oh!  Termometer is broken..

I'm a little concerned that the steeping of grains may have been higher than 165 degrees and tannis were released that shouldn't have been.

Also the hot break never really formed either - it was pretty mild compared to any other hot breaks I've had.

Everything else with my brew day when off without issues.  So we will see what the results are.
