Started a batch if Red Ale today.

Got a long pot thermometer for Christmas and decided to use that for monitoring my steeping of grains.
When I went to unwrap it, the glass on the thermometer was broken so I picked all the glass out to make sure it wouldn’t fall into the pot.

and then decided to use that thermometer and wh I saw the temperature approach 150 so I turn the heat back on the propane 
fire and let it steep for 20 minutes and then went to turn it on and put it to a rolling boil after a while I saw a little medium boil start 
but the temperature on the thermometer never got above 150 actually never really got above 165° or so so then I became rather concerned that the 
steeping of migraines may have been higher than 165° for
