Brewer's Notes

Brew Master: Zachary H. Burns
Brew Name: 
Brew Type: Dunkel Weizenbock Extract
Brew Date: 11/19/2017

Notes:

This beer is a Chocolate Wheat and Munich malt combined to create a rich, malty flavor with hints of clove and banana from the specially selected yeast - alcohol content should be relatively hight at 6.2% or so - which should make it a good winter brew.
