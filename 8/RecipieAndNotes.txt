Brewed on 10/20/2018

I added the spices during the start boil instead of the end.  So I don't think any spices will show up in the flavor since they'll be boiled off.

OG came out to be 1.061 - which was what I was looking for, but finished at 1.021 - but should still be good.

Went from fermenter to keg (may bottle some once carbonated)
