Brewed on 5/28/2018

Nothing substantial - got a small about (less than an ounce) of grain spilled in the pre-wort - but no scortching occurred.

Added 6 pounds of LME at boil
Added 3.254 pounds of LME Extract at 15 minutes

I set my timer wrong and accidentally put the wort chiller in at 40 minutes instead of 20 minutes (to sterilize), but that shouldn't make a difference.

It's was HOT (90+ degrees outside) so seemed like wort took a long time to chill to 80 degrees or so - but I washed both cars with the runoff, so it was probably 30+ minutes to cool it down.

A lot of trub ended up in the fermenter also - but I don't expect this to be a problem either.  It'll be removed at kegging time.

Forgot to get yeast, but the brewing processes already started.  I'll just put it in when I get home and see what happens - don't expect an issue.

OG came out to be 1.061 - which was what I was looking for.
